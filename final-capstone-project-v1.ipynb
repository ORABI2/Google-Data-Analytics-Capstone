    "## Scenario\n",
    "As a data analyst working with the marketing team at Cyclistic company in Chicago. The director believes that the comapany's success depends on maximizing the number of the annual memberships. Therefore the marketing team wants to understand how casual riders and anuual members use Cyclistic bikes differently to design a new strategy. So I will develop some recommendations for the marketing team reinforced with good data insights and attractive visualizations.\n",

    "* **Lily Moreno**: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.  \n",

    "* **Cyclistic executive team**: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.  \n",

    "## Main objectives\n",
    " 1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n",

    "### Data Source / Location\n",
    "We will **collect and gather** Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data to **analyze and identify trends** from this [Source](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)\n",

    "\n",
    "\t 1. **R**eliable - Yes it is, since the the bike-share company **is the parent** of data provider Inc.\n",
    "\t 2. **O**riginal - Yes!, because of it's reliability we can ensure that our data is original\n",
    "\t 3. **C**omprehensive - Yes we got most of the information we neeed to solve the problem\n",
    "\t 4. **C**urrent - Yes, Because our data is new, we got 1 year worth of data **(From: 2022-06 To: 2023-05)**\n",
    "\t 5. **C**ited - Yes \n",
    "\n",
    "\tSo i think our data **ROCCC**s \n",
    "### Data Orgnaization\n",
    "we stored our data into one data frame after merging the 12 CSV files into one CSV file.\n",
    "Here in my case i used python because it's a bit faster so here the **code** i used to merge the files:\n",
